# Star Wars Characters

This project is a web application for viewing and managing Star Wars characters. It allows users to view a list of characters, filter them based on various criteria, and add characters to their favourites.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was chosen for its simplicity, component-based architecture, and strong community support.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language. TypeScript was used to make the code more robust and easier to refactor and debug.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework that provides pre-built components following Material Design guidelines. It was chosen to speed up development and ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It was used to manage global state across the application, such as the list of favourite characters.
